Privacy Policy

Re-Run does *not* collect, store, or transmit any personal data. All GPX files, videos, and run history remain local to your device and are *never shared externally*. The app operates *entirely offline and does not require an account*, subscription, or internet connection.

If you choose to export your runs to third-party platforms like Strava, only the data you explicitly select will be shared, and this action is initiated by you.

Re-Run is open source and transparent by design. You can inspect the code and verify that your privacy is respected at all times.
